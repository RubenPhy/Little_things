#MEDIANIFS Excel Function 

Recently a friend ask me about a function for a real estate analysis. How a function in VBA would be done as SUMIFS or AVERAGEIFS but with MEDIAN? I didn't know at that time, but I few days ago I had some time and, here it is! 

The hardest part (not than hard) was:
-How to be able to input infinite variables.
-How to filter by all the criteria.

I did just for fun, but I thought it could be useful for someone and it would look cleaner than do all the criteria in the Excel sheet.
