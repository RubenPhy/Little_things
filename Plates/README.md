# Unknown loops

My problem was, How to obtain a sequence like this

a,b,c,.....,x,y,z,aa,ab,ac,....,az,ba,bb,....,bz,....,aaa,....,azz....,zzz,...

so to do that I did the final_result.py but it doesn't work if the number if bigger than 26^1 + 26^3 + 26^3.

Because of that reason I used **itertools.product**.
